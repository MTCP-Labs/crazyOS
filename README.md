# CrazyOS
*The crazy Operating System*

----

# Why crazyOS?

The name is quite strange but it represents how experimental this system is.
It is not meant to be used for production, just merely a test to see how the
system works.

----

# What makes us special?

Nothing. We are just crazy programmers attempting build something so complex and crazy
we just named it crazyOS because it sounded like a good fit for our stupidity.

# Wanna contribute?

You can once the barebones has been setup and the OS is bootable.

----

# Wanna contact us?

You can message me on Discord, send a friend request to `shab.xyz` and let me know
you came from the github. Good to make friends or just to ask questions.
